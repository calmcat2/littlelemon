The Capstone project enables you to demonstrate multiple skills from the Certificate by solving an authentic real-world problems. Each module includes a brief recap of, and links to, content that you have covered in previous courses in this program.

To complete this course, you will need back-end developer experience. Additionally, it always helps to have a can-do attitude!

This course consists of four modules:

## **Module 1: Starting the project**

This introductory module will give you some general information about the capstone project.

You'll also review the process of setting up your coding environment, tracking your code using Git and working with the Django framework.

The purpose is to guide you through setting up and beginning your work on the project.

By the end of this module, you will have completed the following:
